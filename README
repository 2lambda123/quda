Release Notes for QUDA v0.3.1                         22 December 2010
-----------------------------

Overview:

QUDA is a library for performing calculations in lattice QCD on
graphics processing units (GPUs) using NVIDIA's "C for CUDA" API.
This release includes optimized kernels for applying several different
Dirac operators (Wilson, clover-improved Wilson, twisted mass,
improved staggered, and domain wall), kernels for performing various
BLAS-like operations, and full inverters built on these kernels.
Mixed-precision implementations of both CG and BiCGstab are provided,
with support for double, single, and half (16-bit fixed-point)
precision.  The staggered implementation additionally includes support
for asqtad link fattening, force terms for the asqtad fermion action
and one-loop improved Symanzik gauge action, and a multi-shift CG
solver.


Software Compatibility:

The library has been tested under Linux (CentOS 5.5 and Ubuntu 10.04)
using release 3.2 of the CUDA toolkit.  CUDA 2.x and earlier are no
longer supported.  The library also seems to work under Mac OS X
10.6.5 ("Snow Leopard") on recent 64-bit Intel-based Macs.

See also "Known Issues" below.


Hardware Compatibility:

For a list of supported devices, see

http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_learn_products.html

Before building the library, you should determine the "compute
capability" of your card, either from NVIDIA's documentation or by
running the deviceQuery example in the CUDA SDK, and set GPU_ARCH in
make.inc appropriately.  Setting GPU_ARCH to 'sm_13' or 'sm_20' will
enable double precision support.


Installation:

In the source directory, copy 'make.inc.example' to 'make.inc', and
edit the first few lines to specify the CUDA install path, the
platform (x86 or x86_64), and the GPU architecture (see "Hardware
Compatibility" above).  Then type 'make' to build the library.

As an optional step, 'make tune' will invoke tests/blas_test to
perform autotuning of the various BLAS-like functions needed by the
inverters.  This involves testing many combinations of launch
parameters (corresponding to different numbers of CUDA threads per
block and blocks per grid for each kernel) and writing the optimal
values to lib/blas_param.h.  The new values will take effect the next
time the library is built.  Ideally, the autotuning should be
performed on the machine where the library is to be used, since the
optimal parameters will depend on the CUDA device and host hardware.
They will also depend slightly on the lattice volume; if desired, the
volume used in the autotuning can be changed by editing
tests/blas_test.cu.

In summary, for an optimized install, run

    make && make tune && make

(after optionally editing blas_test.cu).  By default, the autotuning
is performed using CUDA device 0.  To select a different device
number, set DEVICE in make.inc appropriately.


Using the Library:

Include the header file include/quda.h in your application, link
against lib/libquda.a, and study tests/wilson_invert_test.c (or the
corresponding tests for staggered, domain wall, and twisted mass) for
an example of the interface.  The various inverter options are
enumerated in include/enum_quda.h.


Known Issues:

* When the library is compiled with version 3.0 of the CUDA toolkit
  and run on Fermi (GPU architecture sm_20), the RECONSTRUCT_8 option
  (which enables reconstructing gauge matrices from 8 real numbers)
  gives wrong results in double precision.  This appears to be a bug
  in CUDA 3.0, since CUDA 3.1 has no such issue.  Note that this
  problem isn't likely to matter in practice, since RECONSTRUCT_8
  generally performs worse in double precision than RECONSTRUCT_12.

* Compiling in emulation mode with CUDA 3.0 does not with work when
  the GPU architecture is set to sm_10, sm_11, or sm_12.  One should
  compile for sm_13 instead.  Note that NVIDIA has eliminated
  emulation mode completely from CUDA 3.1 and later.

* For compatibility with CUDA, on 32-bit platforms the library is
  compiled with the GCC option -malign-double.  This differs from the
  GCC default and may affect the alignment of various structures,
  notably those of type QudaGaugeParam and QudaInvertParam, defined in
  quda.h.  Therefore, any code to be linked against QUDA should also
  be compiled with this option.

* At present, combining RECONSTRUCT_NO with half precision will give
  wrong results unless all elements of the gauge field matrices have
  magnitude bounded by 1.  In particular, half precision should
  not be used with asqtad or HISQ fermions, since the "fat links" do
  not satisfy this condition in general.
