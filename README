QUDA v0.x Release Notes
-----------------------


Known issues:

* For compatibility with CUDA, the library is compiled with the GCC option
  -malign-double.  On 32-bit machines, this differs from the GCC default
  and may affect the alignment of various structures, notably those of type
  QudaGaugeParam and QudaInvertParam, defined in invert_quda.h.  As a result,
  it may be necessary to use this switch when compiling code that is to be
  linked against the QUDA library.
