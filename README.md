# QUDA: A library for QCD on GPUs

QUDA is a library for performing calculations in lattice QCD on graphics processing units (GPUs), leveraging NVIDIA's CUDA platform. The current release includes optimized Dirac operators and solvers for the following fermion actions:

* Wilson
* Clover-improved Wilson
* Twisted mass (degenerate or non-degenerate)
* Twisted mass with a clover term
* Staggered fermions
* Improved staggered (asqtad or HISQ)
* Domain wall (4-d or 5-d preconditioned)
*Mobius fermions

Implementations of CG, multi-shift CG, BiCGstab, and DD-preconditioned GCR are provided, including robust mixed-precision variants supporting combinations of double, single, and half (16-bit "block floating point") precision. The library also includes auxiliary routines necessary for Hybrid Monte Carlo, such as HISQ link fattening, force terms and clover-field construction. Use of many GPUs in parallel is supported throughout, with communication handled by QMP or MPI.
Several commonly-used packages integrate support for QUDA as a compile-time option, including Chroma, MILC, CPS, and BQCD (in a specific branch available here).

## Download

*Disclaimer*: This package is undergoing active development, and the interface may change between releases. See the README and NEWS files for the most recent changes.

## Documentation

Current documentation is minimal, consisting mainly of the README file and the examples in the tests/ directory. For those interested in QUDA's internals, reference pages generated by doxygen are available for the current release.

## Getting help

The preferred method for requesting help is to submit an issue, but this currently requires a (free) GitHub account. An alternative is to simply email the developers at quda-developers[at]googlegroups[dot]com. If reporting a bug, please be sure to specify which version of QUDA you're using.
