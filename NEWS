Version 0.x

- Introduced new interface functions newQudaGaugeParam() and
  newQudaInvertParam() to allow for enhanced error checking.  See
  invert_test for an example of their use.
- Modified loadCloverQuda() to take gauge_param as an additional
  parameter.
- Added auto-tuning blas to improve performance (see README for details).
- Improved stability of the half precision 8-parameter SU(3)
  reconstruction (with thanks to Guochun Shi).
- Cleaned up the invert_test example to remove unnecessary dependencies.
- Fixed bug affecting saveGaugeQuda() that caused su3_test to fail.
- Added compiler directive to Makefile to improve performance of the
  half-precision clover Dslash on sm_13 hardware.
- Formally adopted the MIT/X11 license.
