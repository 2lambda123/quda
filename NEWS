Version 0.2.4

- Added initial support for CUDA 3.x and Fermi (not yet optimized).

- Incorporated look-ahead strategy to increase stability of the BiCGstab
  inverter.

- Added definition of QUDA_VERSION to quda.h.  This is an integer with
  two digits for each of the major, minor, and subminor version
  numbers.  For example, QUDA_VERSION is 000204 for version 0.2.4.


Version 0.2.3 - 2 June 2010
 
- Further improved performance of the blas routines.

- Added 3D Wilson Dslash in anticipation of temporal preconditioning.


Version 0.2.2 - 16 February 2010

- Fixed a bug that prevented reductions (and hence the inverter) from working
  correctly in emulation mode.


Version 0.2.1 - 8 February 2010

- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the inverter to fail when spinor
  padding is enabled.

- Significantly improved performance of the blas routines.


Version 0.2 - 16 December 2009

- Introduced new interface functions newQudaGaugeParam() and
  newQudaInvertParam() to allow for enhanced error checking.  See
  invert_test for an example of their use.

- Added auto-tuning blas to improve performance (see README for details).

- Improved stability of the half precision 8-parameter SU(3)
  reconstruction (with thanks to Guochun Shi).

- Cleaned up the invert_test example to remove unnecessary dependencies.

- Fixed bug affecting saveGaugeQuda() that caused su3_test to fail.

- Tuned parameters to improve performance of the half-precision clover
  Dslash on sm_13 hardware.

- Formally adopted the MIT/X11 license.


Version 0.1 - 17 November 2009

- Initial public release.
