Version 0.2.6

- This is a maintenance release.  Please use QUDA 0.3.x for the latest
  features and bugfixes.

- Fixed a long-standing bug in the MatQuda() interface function that
  caused the kappa parameter to be interpreted with the wrong sign for
  plain Wilson fermions.  MatQuda() for clover fermions, as well as
  all other interface functions (including the inverters) were
  unaffected.


Version 0.2.5 - 24 June 2010

- Fixed regression in 0.2.4 that prevented the library from compiling
  when GPU_ARCH was set to sm_10, sm_11, or sm_12.


Version 0.2.4 - 22 June 2010

- Added initial support for CUDA 3.x and Fermi (not yet optimized).

- Incorporated look-ahead strategy to increase stability of the BiCGstab
  inverter.

- Added definition of QUDA_VERSION to quda.h.  This is an integer with
  two digits for each of the major, minor, and subminor version
  numbers.  For example, QUDA_VERSION is 000204 for this release.


Version 0.2.3 - 2 June 2010
 
- Further improved performance of the blas routines.

- Added 3D Wilson Dslash in anticipation of temporal preconditioning.


Version 0.2.2 - 16 February 2010

- Fixed a bug that prevented reductions (and hence the inverter) from working
  correctly in emulation mode.


Version 0.2.1 - 8 February 2010

- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the inverter to fail when spinor
  padding is enabled.

- Significantly improved performance of the blas routines.


Version 0.2 - 16 December 2009

- Introduced new interface functions newQudaGaugeParam() and
  newQudaInvertParam() to allow for enhanced error checking.  See
  invert_test for an example of their use.

- Added auto-tuning blas to improve performance (see README for details).

- Improved stability of the half precision 8-parameter SU(3)
  reconstruction (with thanks to Guochun Shi).

- Cleaned up the invert_test example to remove unnecessary dependencies.

- Fixed bug affecting saveGaugeQuda() that caused su3_test to fail.

- Tuned parameters to improve performance of the half-precision clover
  Dslash on sm_13 hardware.

- Formally adopted the MIT/X11 license.


Version 0.1 - 17 November 2009

- Initial public release.
