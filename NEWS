Version 0.3.0

- CUDA 3.0 or later is now required to build the library.

- Several changes have been made to the interface that require setting
  new parameters in QudaInvertParam and QudaGaugeParam.  See below for
  details.

- The internals of QUDA have been signficantly restructured to facilitate
  future extensions.  This is an ongoing process and will continue
  through the next several releases.

- The inverters might require more device memory than they did before.
  This will be corrected in the next release.

- The CG inverter now supports improved staggered fermions (asqtad or
  HISQ).  Code has also been added for asqtad link fattening, the asqtad
  fermion force, and the one-loop improved Symanzik gauge force, but
  these are not yet exposed through the interface in a consistent way.

- A multi-shift CG solver for improved staggered fermions has been
  added, callable via invertMultiShiftQuda().  This function does not
  yet support Wilson or Wilson-clover.

- It is no longer possible to mix different precisions for the
  spinors, gauge field, and clover term (where applicable).  In other
  words, it is required that the 'cuda_prec' member of QudaGaugeParam
  match both the 'cuda_prec' and 'clover_cuda_prec' members of
  QudaInvertParam, and likewise for the "sloppy" variants.  This
  change has greatly reduced the time and memory required to build the
  library.

- Added 'solve_type' to QudaInvertParam.  This determines how the linear
  system is solved, in contrast to solution_type which determines what
  system is being solved.  When using the CG inverter, solve_type should
  generally be set to 'QUDA_NORMEQ_PC_SOLVE', which will solve the
  even/odd-preconditioned normal equations via CGNR.  (The full
  solution will be reconstructed if necessary based on solution_type.)
  For BiCGstab, 'QUDA_DIRECT_PC_SOLVE' is generally best.  These choices
  correspond to what was done by default in earlier versions of QUDA.

- Added 'dagger' option to QudaInvertParam.  If 'dagger' is set to
  QUDA_DAG_YES, then the matrices appearing in the chosen solution_type
  will be conjugated when determining the system to be solved by
  invertQuda() or invertMultiShiftQuda().  This option must also be set
  (typically to QUDA_DAG_NO) before calling dslashQuda(), MatPCQuda(),
  MatPCDagMatPCQuda(), or MatQuda().

- Eliminated 'dagger' argument to dslashQuda(), MatPCQuda(), and MatQuda()
  in favor of the new 'dagger' member of QudaInvertParam described above.

- Removed the unused blockDim and blockDim_sloppy members from
  QudaInvertParam.

- Added 'type' parameter to QudaGaugeParam.  For Wilson or Wilson-clover,
  this should be set to QUDA_WILSON_LINKS.

- The dslashQuda() function now takes takes an argument of type
  QudaParityType to determine the parity (even or odd) of the output
  spinor.  This was previously specified by an integer.

- Added support for loading all elements of the gauge field matrices,
  without SU(3) reconstruction.  Set the 'reconstruct' member of
  QudaGaugeParam to 'RECONSTRUCT_NO' to select this option, but note
  that it should not be combined with half precision unless the
  elements of the gauge matrices are bounded by 1.  This restriction
  will be removed in a future release.

- Renamed dslash_test to wilson_dslash_test, renamed invert_test to
  wilson_invert_test, and added staggered variants of these test
  programs.

- Improved performance of the half-precision Wilson Dslash.

- Temporarily removed 3D Wilson Dslash.

- Added an 'OS' option to make.inc.example, to simplify compiling for
  Mac OS X.


Version 0.2.5 - 24 June 2010

- Fixed regression in 0.2.4 that prevented the library from compiling
  when GPU_ARCH was set to sm_10, sm_11, or sm_12.


Version 0.2.4 - 22 June 2010

- Added initial support for CUDA 3.x and Fermi (not yet optimized).

- Incorporated look-ahead strategy to increase stability of the BiCGstab
  inverter.

- Added definition of QUDA_VERSION to quda.h.  This is an integer with
  two digits for each of the major, minor, and subminor version
  numbers.  For example, QUDA_VERSION is 000204 for this release.


Version 0.2.3 - 2 June 2010
 
- Further improved performance of the blas routines.

- Added 3D Wilson Dslash in anticipation of temporal preconditioning.


Version 0.2.2 - 16 February 2010

- Fixed a bug that prevented reductions (and hence the inverter) from working
  correctly in emulation mode.


Version 0.2.1 - 8 February 2010

- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the inverter to fail when spinor
  padding is enabled.

- Significantly improved performance of the blas routines.


Version 0.2 - 16 December 2009

- Introduced new interface functions newQudaGaugeParam() and
  newQudaInvertParam() to allow for enhanced error checking.  See
  invert_test for an example of their use.

- Added auto-tuning blas to improve performance (see README for details).

- Improved stability of the half precision 8-parameter SU(3)
  reconstruction (with thanks to Guochun Shi).

- Cleaned up the invert_test example to remove unnecessary dependencies.

- Fixed bug affecting saveGaugeQuda() that caused su3_test to fail.

- Tuned parameters to improve performance of the half-precision clover
  Dslash on sm_13 hardware.

- Formally adopted the MIT/X11 license.


Version 0.1 - 17 November 2009

- Initial public release.
