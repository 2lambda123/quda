Reductions are accelerated if registers are used while local (see
reduce_core and reduce_complex_core).  However, this causes register
spillage for half precision caxpbypzYmbwcDotProductWYNormY slowing it
down, so this isn't implemented in the reduce_triple_core.  Perhaps
use shared memory for this kernel to reduce registers?  This speed up
is likely because double precision reductions actually result in bank
conflicts, though this doesn't seem to affect performance for the
actual tree reduction (1% level).
