Reductions are accelerated if registers are used while local (see
reduce_core and reduce_complex_core).  However, this causes register
spillage for half precision caxpbypzYmbwcDotProductWYNormY slowing it
down, so this isn't implemented in the reduce_triple_core.  Perhaps
use shared memory for this kernel to reduce registers?
